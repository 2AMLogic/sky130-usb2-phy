# design

Analog schematics (xschem). Empty until the sibling analog blocks land — see the repo README scope note.

`design/netlist/` holds synthesized gate-level netlists of the digital partition.
`netlist/usb_utmi_top.v` is the Yosys/`sky130_fd_sc_hd` mapping of the real UTMI top
(experiment `utmi-top`, [`flow/README.md`](../flow/README.md)); it is synthesis output
only, not placed, routed or signed off, and the record beside it discloses a combinational
loop found in the RTL.
